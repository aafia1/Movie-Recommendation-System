# 🎬 Task 5: Movie Recommendation System  

## 📌 Internship  
This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Elevvo Pathways**.  

## 📊 Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to build a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on their viewing and rating patterns. It leverages similarity-based modeling using collaborative filtering.  

## 🗂 Dataset  
- Recommended: [MovieLens 100K Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
- Contains user ratings for movies, useful for collaborative filtering tasks.  

## ⚙️ Steps Performed  
1. **Data Preparation** – created a user-item rating matrix.  
2. **Similarity Computation** – calculated similarity scores between users.  
3. **Recommendation** – recommended top-rated unseen movies for target users.  
4. **Evaluation** – performance measured using Precision@K.  

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

## 📚 Covered Topics  
- Recommendation Systems  
- Similarity-based Modeling  

## 🌟 Bonus Experiments  
- Implemented **Item-based Collaborative Filtering**.  
- Applied **Matrix Factorization (SVD)** for improved recommendations.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aafia1/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
